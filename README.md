### React + redux demo app

This project was generated with react + vite

The intent here is to show how redux fits into a react application

This demo covers several areas.

Within the components 
* CRUD operations for todo items via redux
* Filter manipulation

Within the store
* providing access methods for the components 
* Providing filter behavior
* providing a CRUD client for the API

Incidentals provided to flesh out the demo include
* MSW based mock API so that the demo looks like it's talking to a real backend instead of local storage
* CSS in JSX components so it doesn't look like it was drawn by a 4 year old
